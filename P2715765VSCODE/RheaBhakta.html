Throughout my time here I’ve become a passionate visual storyteller, dedicating myself to capturing and creating stunning imagery that showcases a wide range of unique aspects of the world around us. </p>

From intimate environment captures to striking portraits, my work is designed to transport you as the viewer to new experiences, feelings and connect you to people, places and everyday objects. </p>

      <p>  
        The original portrait picture uses lighting on one side of the subject with a contrasting dark background to create a dramatic effect. The subject is lit from one side, leaving the other side in shadow, which helps to create a sense of depth and contrast. The dark background adds to the contrast by making the subject stand out even more.
        The lighting was achieved in several ways, such as using a single directional light source specifically natural light and by reflecting light off a reflector. The lighting was also controled on thethe subject because it was taken in a professional photography studio. The aim of this portrait was one side of the face to be lit and brighter to show more visible details, while the side that is in shadow appears darker and more mysterious.
        When combined with a dark background, the portrait can have a powerful and moody effect. The subject appears to be emerging from the dark bachground, creating a striking contrast that hopes to draw the viewer's attention. The dark background can also helps to isolate the subject, making them the sole focus of the picture.
        Overall, this picture uses lighting on one side with a contrasting dark background can create a dramatic and visually striking image that captures the subject's visual and hidden emotions.

      <p> 
        This portrait was then edited using adobe Photoshop. This was edited to capture the subject in a vibrant burst of colour. The higher exposure and bold vibrant colours make the subject's features stand out, drawing the eye to their expression. The dark background creates a striking juxtaposition, making the subject stand out even more. It's hoped that this portrait captures the subject's dynamic emotions and leaves a lasting impression.

      <h2> The Original Raw Environment Image</h2>
      <h2> Editied and Enhanced Environment Image</h2>
    
      <p>This photograph showcases the intricate beauty of the decaying environment through the lens of a macro camera. The subject of the image is a dead plant, which is hoped that under closer inspection it reveals a complex texture that is often overlooked. I have used a macro lens to magnify the intricate details of the plant, resulting in an image that is both hauntingly beautiful and thought-provoking. It is hoped the muted tones of the colours and soft focus of the background draw attention to the intricacies of the plant itself, inviting you as the viewer to reflect on the fragility of life and the beauty that can be found in even the most seemingly mundane objects. </p>
      <P> This image of the dead plants has been edited to enhance its visual impact. The original photo may have been a bit darker and less sharp, but I have made some adjustments to make the details of the plant stand out more clearly. The image has been brightened using the sharpen tool to create a stronger contrast between the dead plant and the background, which makes it more visually striking. Additionally, the image has been sharpened to make the texture of the plant more prominent, bringing out the intricate details of the dead plant. This edit not only makes the image more aesthetically pleasing but also draw attention to the beauty of decay in nature.</P>

      <h2> The Original Raw Object Image</h2>
      <h2> Editied and Enhanced Object Image</h2>

      <p> Above shows an object photoshoot. The purpose of this photoshoot was to capture the essence of the university experience that I have been though so far. The main subjects of the shoot was a notebook and pen, which was placed in various positions and angles to create a dynamic composition. This was done through the use of natural lighting to create bright and dark shadows to give depth and convey the happy and exciting parts of university. Not only that the rule of thirds was used to create a visually pleasing and a balanced composition with the notebook and pen positioned off-centre to create empty space. This will leave some blank space to convey the challenges university can give. This image will capture the feeling of studying, the lifestyle, and learning not only academically but also growing as a young adults though the use of natural lighting and composition techniques enhancing the emotional impact of the image.</p>
      <p> After the object photoshoot of the notebook and pen, the images were edited using Adobe Photoshop. The editing process included the application of several techniques to enhance the image and make it more visually appealing. The sharpen tool was used to enhace the lookquality of the image, which helped to bring out the details and textures of the notebook and pen. Additionally, the spotlight tool was used to create a focal point on the notebook and pen, which drew the viewer's attention to the main subjects of the image. Light filters were also applied to create a warm and inviting atmosphere, which further enhanced the emotional impact of the images. Overall, the use of these editing techniques helped to create a set of visually stunning images that effectively captured the essence of the notebook and pen and conveyed the story of the university experience.</p>
