         <p> As part of my university course, I was tasked to create an video advertisement. I chose to produce an advert for Lucozade Sport, the ultimate performance drink for athletes. My advert showcases the power of Lucozade Sport to enhance athletic performance. My advert has a focus on how Lucozade Sport helps athletes get inspired and help sustain energy during intense training sessions. The advert centres around a singular athlete as he pushes though his limits to achieve his goals with the help of Lucozade Sport. Through stunning visuals and an inspiring message, my advert aims to showcase how Lucozade Sport can be the perfect companion for anyone striving to reach their full potential during their workouts. </p>

      <!--The below code is Java script. This was sourced from W3 Schools. This Java code has been used because it allows the user to change the size of the video. This is needed because it may help with accessibilty of the webiste for exmaple people with sight issues can make the video bigger or smaller depending on their needs. Even though this code was copied, Parts of it has been edited to suite my webistes style and purpose. For exmaple the buttons were linked to the button style element so they matched the aesthetics of the webiste. Not only this I have also added a cover page to the video to make it look more aesethtically pleasing to the viewer. In this Code I have also added an alternative video element just in case the user cant access the original MP4 format.   -->
